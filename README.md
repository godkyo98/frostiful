# Build and Run

Frostiful is built using [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) using the [Fabric Loom Gradle plugin](https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric-loom).

```bash
# builds a production jar of Frostiful
./gradlew build 

# runs Frostiful's unit tests
./gradlew check

# runs Frostiful's game tests
./gradlew runGametest
```

## Updating structures

Frostiful has a custom run configuration for updating structure templates between Minecraft versions, to account for changes in datafixer format. To run this configuration, place your structure template `.nbt` files in `run/structure_update/structure` and then run the following command:

```bash
./gradlew runUpdateStructures
```

This will dump the updated NBT files into `run/structure_update/generated/structure`. Note that you will need to agree to Minecraft's [EULA](https://account.mojang.com/documents/minecraft_eula) for this to work.

> [!WARNING]
> This only works for vanilla stuff, so if needed you may have to temporarily and manually change the ID to the closest vanilla thing for the datafixes to apply, eg `frostiful:chillager` -> `minecraft:pillager`
