**Frostiful** is a Vanilla+ combat and survival temperature mod that substantially reworks the Powder Snow freezing mechanics. It introduces more ways of freezing and being frozen, as well as new methods for warming up again.

## Freezing

There are now many more ways to freeze to death in addition to powder snow with Frostiful installed. Passive freezing, icicles, and new enchantments are some of the exciting new ways that you can now freeze to death!

There are also new ways of resisting the cold! Use **Fur Tufts** to craft fur armor, which provides **Frost Resistance** to help you keep warm and resist the creeping winter. When you get too cold, warm up by the light of a fire or by getting some heat from a **Sun Lichen-covered rock**, or even steal the heat from your enemies with Enervation!

## Frostology and the Re-Branded Iceologer

**Frostology** is a new form of Illager magic that deals with all matters of cold and frost. **Frostologers** are a new take on the Iceologer from Minecraft Dungeons, and they are the master of this magic. They reside in their snowy fortresses in the Snowy Plains and Ice Spikes biomes, where they are surrounded by an army of **Chillagers** at their call. Chillagers wield Crossbows loaded with Glacial Arrows that are capable of long-distance freezing. Having mastered the magic of Frost, the Frostologer is not immune to freezing, but is instead strengthened by it. When they are cold, they gain tremendous power. However, that power is lost if they warm up again.

You can wield this magic, too. By defeating the Frostologer you are able to craft the **Frost Wand**, which can cast spells that freeze your enemies in place when they are hit. If you can demonstrate your mastery over the cold by defeating an Ominous Frostologer Trial, you can also get the **Cloak of Frostology**. The Cloak is an **obtainable cape** item that reverses the effects of freezing to make you become like the Frostologer yourself. Be careful though! With the Frostology Cloak on, you will begin to melt if you get too warm!

# Permissions

Frostiful is licensed under [LGPLv3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0.en.html). You can use this mod in mod packs, YouTube videos, or anything else. You may copy, modify, and redistribute this mod provided you abide by the terms set forth in the license.

# Configuration

Frostiful is extremely highly configurable. It has an extensive config that lets you play around with different settings, disable features, or tweak the values of various things to adjust the difficulty of the mod. For example, if you're not all that into survival or have another temperature mod like EnvironmentZ, but still wanna try out the Frost Wand, you can completely disable passive freezing! It also has a fair amount of datapack integration for more complex things like temperature effects.

The config page on the wiki is the best source of what each option does, so be sure to read that before delving into the config for Frostiful: https://github.com/TheDeathlyCow/frostiful/wiki/Config

Frostiful also exposes a number of vanilla mechanics related to freezing to configuration or datapacks, such as what boots can be used to walk on powder snow, how much and how often freeze damage applies when fully frozen, and the effects you get from being cold.

#  Mod Integrations

Frostiful has built-in integrations for many mods. You can get even more from [Thermoo Patches](https://modrinth.com/mod/thermoo-patches), which offers a suite of integration patches for many other mods, such as Origins, Fabric Seasons, Serene Seasons, Colorful Hearts, Overflowing Bars, Armor Points++, Ad Astra, and more!

* [Tips](https://modrinth.com/mod/tips): Added some Frostiful-specific tips
* [Enchantment Descriptions](https://modrinth.com/mod/enchantment-descriptions): Descriptions are provided for Frostiful's enchantments
* [Trinkets](https://modrinth.com/mod/trinkets): The Cloak of Frostology can be equipped in the Cape slot to not have any effect, and just be cosmetic item

### Compatibility

While this mod is designed to be as compatible as possible with other mods, it is inevitable that sometimes issues will arise. Specific incompatibilities will be documented here and on the [wiki](https://github.com/TheDeathlyCow/frostiful/wiki#compatibility) as they become known.

Note that other temperature mods, such as Thermite or EnvironmentZ do not work with Frostiful's temperature system and likely never will. Running Frostiful with these mods is redundant as they also add their own temperature system in addition to Frostiful. These mods may technically run together, however if you want to have a warm temperature system with Frostiful I would recommend using [Scorchful](https://modrinth.com/mod/scorchful) instead, as it was made to work together with Frostiful.

# Other Recommended Mods

These mods aren't made by me, but I think they're pretty neat and go well with Frostiful:

* [Scorchful](https://modrinth.com/mod/scorchful): Scorchful is Frostiful's heat-based sister mod, and they are designed to work together. If you like Frostiful, then give Scorchful a try!
* [Snow! Real Magic](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/snow-real-magic-fabric): Really helps the snowy ambience, and goes with icicles really well!
* [Immersive Weathering](https://modrinth.com/mod/immersive-weathering): Adds some neat features that go along with Frostiful well. You may want to disable their icicles, though.
* [Trinkets](https://modrinth.com/mod/trinkets): If you just want to have the Cloak of Frostology as a cosmetic item, equip it in the Trinkets cape slot!
* [Dehydration](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/dehydration): Adds a thirst bar, for when you're really into the survival thing.
