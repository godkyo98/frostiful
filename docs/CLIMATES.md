This is to document how I am organizing the different climate for the new Thermoo environment datapack system.

above 10C - unaffected by Frostiful
10C and below - temperature point change of -1 per -10K (10C = -1/tick, 0C = -2/tick, -10 = -3/tick)

biomes base temperature sources:
- freezing: utqiagvik, AK
- cold: yellowknife, NT
- cool: montreal, QC
- temperate: vancouver, BC

use the average LOWS - highs will be set by modifiers
