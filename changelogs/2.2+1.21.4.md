# Pale Gums Drop

This is the first release of Frostiful for Minecraft 1.21.4. It contains a couple small fixes and no new features; this port was pretty straight forward. It is still initially released as a beta as some things may still be broken. Please report any issues to: [https://github.com/TheDeathlyCow/frostiful/issues](https://github.com/TheDeathlyCow/frostiful/issues)

This also marks the end of official support for 1.21.3 and 1.20.1. However, 1.21.1 is still fully supported!

* Updated to 1.21.4

* Added a few new tags for repairing items
* Fixed fire particles missing from standing on Magma blocks
* Added resin trim material to custom armor trims
* Fixed Frostologer not properly destroying heat sources with its blizzard attack
